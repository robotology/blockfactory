# How to autogenerate C++ code

The capability of autogenerating C++ code from a Simulink model is provided by Simulink Coder. BlockFactory received a preliminary support of this toolbox, and only basic features are currently supported.
If you are already building your Simulink autogenerated code via CMake, to start using code autogenerated from models that use BlockFactory's blocks, you simply need to look for `BlockFactory` in CMake as any other dependency via:
~~~cmake
find_package(BlockFactory COMPONENTS SimulinkCoder REQUIRED)
~~~

and then link your target that contains the autogenerated code to the `BlockFactory::SimulinkCoder` imported target:
~~~cmake
target_link_libraries(<targetwithautogeneratecode> PRIVATE BlockFactory::SimulinkCoder)
~~~

For more advanced uses, check the following example:

- [`AutogenerationExample.mdl`](https://github.com/robotology/blockfactory/tree/master/example/matlab/AutogenerationExample.mdl) A Simulink model with the right configuration of Simulink Coder
- [`example/matlab/AutogenerationExample_grt_rtw`](https://github.com/robotology/blockfactory/tree/master/example/matlab/AutogenerationExample_grt_rtw) The folder containing the autogenerated sources
- ['example/matlab/CMakeLists.txt'](https://github.com/robotology/blockfactory/blob/master/example/matlab/CMakeLists.txt) The CMake file for compiling the generated code
- [`src/main.cpp`](https://github.com/robotology/blockfactory/tree/master/example/src/main.cpp) A simple main function to execute the autogenerated code
