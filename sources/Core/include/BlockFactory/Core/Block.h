/**
 * @brief Basic abstract class for wrapping generic algorithms
 *
 * ### Rationale
 *
 * This class is aimed to wrap generic algorithms and it represents the most basic component of
 * `BlockFactory`.
 *
 * The entire execution of a generic algorithm can be split in the following major steps:
 *
 * - Initialization: implemented with core::Block::configureSizeAndPorts, core::Block::initialize
 * - Execution: implemented with core::Block::output
 * - Termination: implemented with core::Block::terminate
 *
 * Considering that the main aim of this framework at its beginning was the integration with
 * Simulink, it contains other methods for exposing the algorithm as a Simulink block.
 *
 * ### Main concept
 *
 * A generic application is the composition of many algorithms sharing and processing each other
 * data. Every algorithm is represented by a core::Block, and the data shared with other blocks is
 * carried by core::Signal.
 *
 * The block is generally unaware of the data that it will process, and it is only interested in
 * knowing how many input / output signals are connected, their size and data type. Blocks have the
 * concept of _ports_, which are the connections between external core::Signal and the block itself.
 *
 * @remark A signal can be plugged to more than one port.
 *
 * This kind of information is set by a core::BlockInformation object, and it is specific to the
 * framework where the algorithm runs (e.g. standalone C++ code, Simulink, etc).
 *
 * Beyond this, an algorithm often needs parameters. This class provides functionalities to gather
 * them in a core::Parameters object.
 *
 * ### Other information
 *
 * You can create a new block by deriving from this class and implementing at least all the abstract
 * methods.
 *
 * @note This block interface assumes that algorithms are represented as instantaneous
 *       systems, there is no default storage capability between different sampling times. However,
 *       concrete blocks can have buffers that retain previous data. \par
 * @note Despite some of the methods inside this class look Simulink-dependent, objects of this
 *       class are completely generic. In fact, core::Block only provides algorithm callbacks, and
 *       the operation to set input / output data is demanded to the core::BlockInformation
 *       interface. For what concerns Simulink, a mex::SimulinkBlockInformation implementation is
 *       provided. \par
